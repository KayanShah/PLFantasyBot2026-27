## What this is

FPL team selection is fundamentally two problems:

1. **Predict** how many points each player will score.
2. **Optimize** squad, captain, and transfer choices under FPL's budget and formation rules.

This project pulls data from the official FPL API and other sources, predicts player performance, and uses optimization to pick the best legal squad — see [research.md](research.md) for the full write-up of data sources, modeling approaches, and the optimization strategy this is built on.

## Repo layout

| Path | Description |
|---|---|
| [`research.md`](research.md) | Research notes: FPL API endpoints, data sources, prediction approaches, optimization strategy. |
| [`FantasyRules.md`](FantasyRules.md) | Official FPL rules: squad/budget constraints, scoring system, transfers, chips. |
| [`scrapers/scrape_fixtures.py`](scrapers/scrape_fixtures.py) | Scrapes all season fixtures (teams, kickoff times, difficulty ratings, scores) from the FPL API. |
| `data/` | Output from the scrapers (`fixtures.csv`, `fixtures.json`). |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies. |

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Scrape the current season's fixtures:

```bash
python3 scrapers/scrape_fixtures.py
```

Outputs `data/fixtures.csv` and `data/fixtures.json`.

## Data source

All fixture and player data comes from the official (undocumented) Fantasy Premier League API at `https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/`. See [research.md](research.md#21-official-fantasy-premier-league-api-free-no-key-required) for the full endpoint reference.
